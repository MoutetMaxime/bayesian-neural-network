# Bayesian Neural Networks: Implementation and Notebook

## Overview
This repository contains:
1. **`BayesianNeuralNetwork.py`**: Python script implementing a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) using PyTorch. It includes Bayesian layers, variational inference, and Bayes by Backpropagation.
2. **Notebook**: Demonstrates the training and evaluation of the BNN on the MNIST dataset, with comparisons to standard neural networks.

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install torch numpy matplotlib
