# Bayesian Neural Networks: Implementation and application to MNIST classification

## Overview
This repository contains:
1. **`BayesianNeuralNetwork.py`**: Python script implementing a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) using PyTorch. It includes Bayesian layers and Bayes by Backpropagation.
2. **mnist_experiment.ipynb**: Demonstrates the training and evaluation of the BNN on the MNIST dataset, with comparisons to standard neural networks.

## Quick Start
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install torch numpy matplotlib
